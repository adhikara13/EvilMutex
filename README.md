**Malware Mutex Intelligence Platform**

A comprehensive database of malware mutex signatures for threat intelligence, detection engineering, and cybersecurity research.

## What is EvilMutex?

Mutexes (mutual exclusion objects) are used by malware to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously. Each malware family typically uses unique mutex names, making them excellent fingerprints for threat identification and detection.

## Quick Start

Visit the live platform: **[evilmutex.org](https://evilmutex.org)**

## License
