  description: "Gryphon is a ransomware-type virus discovered by malware security researcher Leo. It's a variant of BTCWare ransomware. Once infiltrated, Gryphon encrypts stored data and appends filenames with extensions like '.[test].gryphon', '.[decr@cock.li].gryphon', and '.[bravobravo@cock.li].gryphon'. Following successful encryption, it creates a text file ('!## DECRYPT FILES ##!.txt') containing ransom demands in each folder with encrypted files. Updated variants use .crypton extensions with email addresses like gladius_rectus@aol.com and macgregor@aolonline.top."
